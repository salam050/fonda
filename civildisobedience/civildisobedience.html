			<h1 class="revealthree">BDS: Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions</h1>
			<div class="bdsbio"> <p class="bio">BDS is a Palestinian-led movement for their freedom, justice and equality. Inspired by the South-African Apartheid movement, they launched in 2005 in response to Israel’s colonization and occupation of Palestinian land and infringement upon Palestinian human rights. BDS uses their global network to call on Israel to comply with international law and respect their fundamental rights. This campaign is based on boycotts of all Israeli and international companies that do not respect Palestinian rights, divestment of investments in the Israeli state and Israeli companies, and international sanctions on Israel by ending military and free-trade agreements as well as Israel’s membership in international forums. With the support of unions, churches, NGOs and other international movements, BDS has a real economic impact on Israel, which gets them much closer to having their rights and humanity recognized.</p> </div>

			<h1 class="revealfour">Occupy Wall Street</h1>
			<div class="owsbio"> <p class="bio">Occupy Wall Street was a 2011 protest against economic inequality. It took place in New York City’s Wall Street financial district. Some of the goals of the movement were to minimize the influence of corporations on politics, a more balanced distribution of income, better and more plentiful job opportunities, bank reform, forgiveness of student loan debt or other relief for students, and alleviation of the foreclosure situation. For two months, somewhere between 100 and 200 people slept in Zuccotti Park, where the protests were centered. This was a huge movement that let financiers and government officials know about the people’s discontent with the shortfalls they experienced with the government’s economic system. While the movement had a large number of participants and supporters, they did not have clear enough goals to produce any concrete results.</p> </div>

			<h1 class="revealfive">Black Lives Matter</h1>
			<div class="blmbio"> <p class="bio">Black Lives Matter began on social media in 2013 in response to relentless violence and brutality against black people by US government entities. It began with three black women utilizing the hashtag #BlackLivesMatter as a platform and organizing tool. This allowed them to hold conversations about the violence that their community was experiencing at the hands of the state, only amplified by Michael Brown’s murder in 2014. It was here that the movement really took off, as organizers from across the country had all come together in Ferguson for support and took all that they learned back to their homes. Black Lives Matter is now a chapter-based organization across the United States that organizes together to protest and speak out against police and other state-sanctioned violence against black people. They imagine a world free of anti-blackness, where all black people can have the social, economic and political power to completely thrive.</p> </div>

			<h1 class="revealsix">#NoDAPL Standing Rock Protests</h1>
			<div class="nodaplbio"> <p class="bio">#NODAPL refers to the 2016 protest against the construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline on the sacred burial ground of the Standing Rock Sioux in North Dakota. This campaign picked up a lot of steam and became very popular on social media, but also resulted in the gathering of various indigenous groups on the Standing Rock reservation in North Dakota to protest against the pipeline, where they were met with repression by rubber bullets, tear gas, and attack dogs. The Standing Rock Sioux were concerned about the pipeline’s potential environmental and spiritual impacts, were the construction allowed to go forward. This movement became very popular within environmental and indigenous movements, as the pipeline’s eventual construction posed a clear threat to the health and wellbeing of the land’s inhabitants. It did get constructed, but the movement’s popularity cast indigenous struggles into the spotlight on social media.</p> </div>

			<h1 class="revealseven">Women's March</h1>
			<div class="womensbio"> <p class="bio">The Women’s March is a women-led movement that is committed to dismantling systems of oppression against women through nonviolent protest and conversation. Their main concerns are violence against women and girls, reproductive rights, LGBTQIA+ rights, worker’s rights, civil rights, disability rights, immigrant rights, and environmental justice. It began on a large scale in January 2017, right after Donald Trump was inaugurated. The march in Washington, D.C. was the largest single-day protest in U.S. history, though there were lots of other marches throughout the U.S. for women that did not make it to D.C. They aim to harness the political power of women to create transformative social change in the U.S. political system.</p> </div>

			<h1 class="revealeight">March For Our Lives</h1>
			<div class="mfolbio"> <p class="bio">March for Our Lives became a nationwide movement in 2018 following one of the deadliest school shootings in US history that took place at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School. In the days after the shooting took place, students from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School mobilized to try and make sure that no one else would have to experience that level of loss and terror due to gun violence ever again. Their activism and organization of nationwide student protests led to the change of a Florida law that raised the legal rifle-owner age from 18 to 21 with a three-day wait. Today, they continue to hold protests and actions, and they lobby Congress to close loopholes and pass common-sense gun laws.</p> </div>

			<h1 class="revealnine">School Strike For Climate</h1>
			<div class="ssfcbio"> <p class="bio">Greta Thunberg started the School Strike for Climate in August of 2018. She committed to striking outside of the Swedish parliament building instead of going to school in response to the complete non-response of the Swedish government to the climate crisis. She demanded that Sweden commit to reducing carbon emissions per the Paris Agreement. Worldwide protests began happening in November of 2018 as high schoolers demanded that elected officials do something about climate change before it is too late. Greta's School Strike for Climate turned into Fridays and inspired countless others. Protests have been met with mixed responses: the Prime Minister of the UK criticized the strikes for wasting time and Australia's Education Minister said students should care about issues during the weekend. In spite of this, the movement continues to grow and students are committed to protesting until governments make positive change.</p> </div>

			<h1 class="revealten">Fire Drill Fridays</h1>
			<div class="firebio"> <p class="bio">Fire Drill Fridays is Jane Fonda's response to youth climate protests that began in January 2020. A lifelong activist, Fonda realized the importance of the climate crisis and has mobilized herself and countless other celebrities to bring notice to it. Every Friday, Fonda and her supporters march through the streets, at first in Washington D.C. and later in Los Angeles, demanding that the government pass a new green deal and stop burning fossil fuels. She willingly gets arrested by refusing to leave picket lines in order to both make headlines and protect others who cannot afford such arrests. Other celebrities have joined her to be arrested including Manny Jancito, Joaquin Phoenix, Martin Sheen, Sally Field, and countless others, showing just how important climate action is. This celebrity-backed movement has led to thousands of people acknowledging the severity of the climate crisis and refusing to stay quiet any longer.</p> </div>
